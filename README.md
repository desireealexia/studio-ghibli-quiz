### Colour Palette

![Studio Ghibli Quiz Colour Palette](assets/images/readme/colour-palette.png)
Below is a detailed description of each colour and its usage:

**#0A3D62 (Deep Teal/Indigo Blue)**: This color evokes a sense of calm and mystery, similar to the skies and ocean scenes often depicted in Studio Ghibli films. This can work well for primary text, headers, or even background sections where strong contrast is needed.

**#FBC02D (Golden Yellow)**: This bright, warm colour brings to mind sunlight, warmth, and the vibrancy of nature. It's reminiscent of the golden fields and sunsets in many Ghibli films. This colour is great for call-to-action buttons, highlights, and elements that need to draw attention.

**#92272D (Rusty Red/Burgundy)**: This deep red adds a grounded, earthy feel to your palette, reflecting the natural and rustic tones in Studio Ghibli's worlds. Ideal for accents, secondary buttons, or borders to add depth and contrast to your design.

**#3A5A40 (Forest Green)**: A rich, natural green that represents the lush, verdant landscapes often seen in Ghibli films. It’s calming and organic. This colour can be used for navigation bars, background accents, or secondary text, offering a natural balance in the palette.

**#F8F1E5 (Light Ivory)**: A soft, neutral background colour that’s warm and inviting, similar to the gentle tones found in Ghibli’s settings. This is perfect for your main background colour, providing a clean, readable surface for text and other elements.

### Typography

### Imagery

The quiz utilises **ITC Avant Garde Gothic**, the same font used in the Studio Ghibli logo, to maintain brand consistency and evoke the unique aesthetic of the studio:

- **Headings:** _ITC Avant Garde Gothic LT Medium_ is used for headings, providing a bold and clear emphasis on key sections.
- **Body Text:** _ITC Avant Garde Gothic LT Book_ is used for the main text, offering a clean and readable experience for users.
